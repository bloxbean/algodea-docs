# Debug Atomic Transfer using Dry Run Dump file

Similar to Stateful Contract debug, a dry run dump file can be exported in the atomic transfer UI. You can then use the dry run dump file to debug the contract.

* Right click on a dry run dump file \(which can be found under build/dryrun\) and select "Start TEAL Debugger" option
