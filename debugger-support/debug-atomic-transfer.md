# Debug Atomic Transfer

* To debug an atomic transfer, you need to first export individual transactions using corresponding transactions UIs.
* If atomic transfer has a stateless contract, you need to also create a lsig file which will be later used during transaction signing.
* Make sure to select source file for each smart contract transaction through "Dry Run Source" option in Atomic Transfer UI.

The following video shows how to debug an atomic transfer with a stateful contract and stateless contract.
